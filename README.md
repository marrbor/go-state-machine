### Mealy Machine
 A mealy machine is defined as a machine in theory of computation whose output values are determined by both its current state and current inputs. In this machine atmost one transition is possible.


### Moore Machine
 A moore machine is defined as a machine in theory of computation whose output values are determined only by its current state.
